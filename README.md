# linkedlist-implementation

## Directions
- Create .rb file and define the Linked List and Node classes keeping object oriented principles in mind. 
- Author methods to add a value, search for a value, count the number of entries and delete a value from the linked list, assuming that the values in each nodes are integers.
- Be mindful of when the linked list is empty (before adding the first node, after deleting the last node etc.) in your methods. Do the above for a singly linked list and a separate file for a doubly linked list.
